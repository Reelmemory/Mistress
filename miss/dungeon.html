        <h1>MY DUNGEON</h1>
        <p>You can see the ideal harmony of sophistication and perversion as soon as you walk into my lair. Against a backdrop of solid wood, black leather, and intimidating metal, the large main room is adorned with rich velvet drapes and illuminated by seductive chandeliers. The ten-foot ceiling has a suspension system hanging from it, along with my throne, where the worship starts, a sling where you might be bound, a welcoming bench facing a big mirror, a St. Andrew cross, a trampling table, a cage where you might be placed, and more. I've already overloaded your senses, and that's exactly what I wanted. I created this space for the ones who desire an authentic BDSM experience in the hands of a refined Dominatrix.
          <br>
          <br>
            Around the corner, you witness my extensive collection of high quality implements, accessories, restrains and toys.
            Further, a bright white room peaks behind a peculiar curtain where stands a full medical room. Become the patient of a deviant nurse and let your body be stimulated by a range of interesting tools and devices.
            
            On the other side, sissies can enjoy a cozy area where they can be transformed and strutted. Further down, a dark room exposes more heavy bondage equipment, a prison cell for long term captivity and a bar for who is lucky enough to be invited to have a drink with a Goddess after a session, or perhaps just to be used as a foot stool underneath.
            
            -Private entrance. Free street parking.
            
            -Large shower; perfect for watersports.</p>
