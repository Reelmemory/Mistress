    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>As a young woman, I was regularly picking up fights with men over disrespectful conduct and sexism. My physique would intend that I could resist and my fearless attitude could intimidate most of the boys. I would always stand up for myself, speak up and fight if I had to. Growing older, life taught me to choose my battles more wisely and that most of them were unworthy of my consumption of negative energy. 
      <br>
      I found my own normality within the BDSM community. With my fascination for the psychological side of domination, my thrill-seeking propensity and sadistic tendencies, I found myself impersonalizing my own preconceived notion of a dominatrix. And I couldn’t be in a better place.
      <br>
      Being a strong supporter of equity in a noticeably patriarchal society and a promoter of female empowerment, I decided to dedicate my career to represent FEMDOM (Female Domination) in order to inspire and lift up women and overthrow patriarchy by bringing men to the marvellous world of submission. Female supremacy rules my dungeon and tone my power dynamics. Of course, all genders are welcome to surrender and submit; My dungeon is a safe space: discrimination is not tolerated and inclusion is inherent to BDSM. As a professional Dominatrix, I am constantly evolving to become the best version of myself and I now can say with confidence that I reached multiple personal achievements in my career and I am now on the path of education of aspiring Dommes. 
      <br>
      <br>
      I will forever advocate self expression, encourage the pursuit of dreams and fantasy realization and conduct no judgements whatsoever. I am fascinated by the insight into the private places of other people’s minds and I’m delighted to be trusted and acclaimed to dive in with a comprehensive understanding of BDSM.
